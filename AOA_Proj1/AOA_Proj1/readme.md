First, a set of house information is given, including the start and end paintable time of each house. The goal of the problem is to paint all the houses in the fewest number of days. Painting times can overlap between houses.

The function HousePainterRun1 implements a simple greedy strategy: select the house with the earliest start time from the houses that can be painted every day to paint, and repeat this process until all houses are painted. The specific implementation process is as follows: first, initialize a variable index to record the number of houses that have been painted; then, from the first day, repeat the following operations until all houses are painted:

1. Traverse all houses that have not been painted, and find all houses whose start time is less than or equal to the current number of days day;

2. Find the house with the latest end time from these houses and mark it as the house to be painted;

3. Add this house to the result list paintedHouse, and add 1 to the index.

The function HousePainterRun2 implements an optimized strategy of choosing the house with the latest start time for painting. First initialize an empty priority queue avaiHouse to store all houses that can be painted. In order to facilitate the selection of the house with the latest start time, all houses are sorted in descending order of start time; from the first day, repeat the following operations until all houses are painted:

1. Add all houses whose start time is less than or equal to the current number of days to the priority queue avaiHouse;

2. Take out the house with the latest end time from the queue and mark it as the house to be painted;

3. Add this house to the result list paintedHouse.

The function HousePainterRun3 implements another optimization strategy, which is to choose the house with the shortest duration to paint. The specific implementation process is similar to that of HousePainterRun2, except that in the first step, all the houses are sorted in ascending order of duration.

The function HousePainterRun4 implements a relatively simple optimization strategy, which is to choose the house with the earliest end time to paint. The specific implementation process is similar to that of HousePainterRun2, except that in the first step, all houses are sorted from small to large by end time.
